derplang ( by Jesse Horne )
===========================
derplang is an esoteric programming language.

To run a derp script, put derplang.lua into the file where your derp script is, go into
terminal, and type "lua derplang.lua filename.derp"

This version has only been tested with Lua 5.1!

Note: A script is all on one line. Yes sir it does make a difference!

This language is being developed by Jesse Horne himself. He has no idea why he is, and
may give up on it if he doesn't get enough positive feedback. So either email at
j.horne2796 AT gmail DOT com or donate buy him a drink or two by donating to his paypal
which is also that same email. 

A tutorial on derplang is coming soon. Until then, hack away, read the code, or
enjoy your example scripts!
